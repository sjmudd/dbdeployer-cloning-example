Simple script to show how to clone a MySQL 8.0.17+ server using [MySQL native cloning](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/clone-plugin.html).
This uses [dbdeployer](https://github.com/datacharmer/dbdeployer).
See the script clone_script for details and sample_output.log
for an example of what you would see.
